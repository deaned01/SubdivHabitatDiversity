# SubDivHabitatModels
R code to predict shared species (zeta diversity) and total diversity using zeta components as presented in the paper "A null model for quantifying the geometric effect of habitat subdivision on species diversity", published in Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2021.

Includes test data (Barro Colorado Island 2005 census) and functions necessary to:

1. sample from a stem-mapped forest at a given sampling grain 
2. estimate the c-parameter for alpha diversity at that grain
3. predict shared species for m samples
4. calculate gamma diversity and single-patch endemics for the m samples
