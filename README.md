# SubDivHabitatModels
R code to predict shared species (zeta diversity) and total diversity using zeta components.

Includes test data (Barro Colorado Island 2005 census) and functions necessary to sample from a stem-mapped forest at a given sampling grain, estimate the c-parameter for alpha diversity at that grain then predict shared species for m samples and calculate gamma diversity and single-patch endemics for the m samples.
